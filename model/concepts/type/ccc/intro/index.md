A complex type with complex content (CCC) is a structure that represents an object and may contain elements and attributes.

A CCC type represents an object with properties, rather than a simple value.

{:.example}
- Examples of CCC types in NIEM include:
- `nc:PersonType`, which includes properties like name, birthday, and height.
- `nc:LocationType`, which includes properties like an address and a lat/long coordinate.
- `nc:ContactInformationType`, which includes properties like a telephone number and an email address.
