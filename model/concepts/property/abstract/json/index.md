The concept of an abstract element does not exist in JSON like it does in XML; however, the idea behind it can still be represented in a similar manner.  In any XML instance, an abstract element should not appear.  It can either be omitted or replaced by one or more assigned substitutions.  This should occur in JSON as well.

See the [Substitutable Elements in JSON](../../substitutable/json) section for more.
