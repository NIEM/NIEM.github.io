A property represents a concept, idea, or thing.  It defines specific semantics and appears in exchanges as the tag or label for a field.

Properties may be more commonly known as as elements, attributes, fields, tags, keys, or keywords.

{: .example}
> One of the properties defined in Core is `PersonBirthDate`.  It represents a person's birthday and will carry that value in an exchange.

On its own, a property has meaning but no inherent structure.

{: .example}
- Without a type, any kind of value could be provided for property `PersonBirthDate` above, including:
- 06/30/1950
- 1950-06-30
- June 30th, 1950
- green (without a type, any value is valid)

A property must have an assigned type in order to have both clear semantics and a well-defined structure.
