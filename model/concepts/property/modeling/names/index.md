The following provides rules and guidance for naming properties.

## Basics

A single NIEM component name may consist of multiple terms. A term is a meaningful word, an abbreviation for a word, or an acronym.

### OED Terms

Besides the additional accepted terms listed below, terms should be real words as defined by the [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/).

### Spelling

For consistency, words should use the preferred U.S. spelling as defined in the [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/).

### Additional terms

Additional terms that may be used are:
- `ID`, the authorized abbreviation for `Identifier`
- `URI`, the authorized abbreviation for `Uniform Resource Identifier`
- [Local terminology](../../local-term), defined by a NIEM namespace.

## Parts of a name

In accordance with [IEC/ISO 11179 Part 5](http://metadata-standards.org/11179/), terms that make up a NIEM property name are classified into four basic parts according to their placement and function.

A term in a property name can be one of:

### Object term

An object term is the real world object or concept to which this name applies.

- This may be omitted if the property is very generic and no specific class applies.

{: .example}
- `AircraftFuselageColorCode` - A color of the main body of an aircraft.
- `Aircraft` is the object term.  In this example, that is the object being modeled.

### Property term

The characteristic or portion of the object to which this name applies.

{: .example}
- `AircraftFuselageColorCode` - A color of the main body of an aircraft.
- `Color` is the property term.  This is the primary characteristic of the property name.  The value of this property will be a color.

### Representation term

A term indicating the kind of value a property carries.

- A representation term, if present, must appear as the final term of the name.
- Representation terms are required for properties that carry a simple value, like a string or a number.
- Representation terms are required for other properties with specific types.

See the [Reference Table](../table) for the list of representation terms.

{: .example}
- `AircraftFuselageColorCode` - A color of the main body of an aircraft.
- `Code` is the representation term.  It indicates the general kind of value to expect.

### Qualifier term

More specific information applicable to the object, property, or representation term.

- Multiple qualifier terms may be used if needed.
- Qualifiers are optional.

{: .example}
- `AircraftFuselageColorCode` - A color of the main body of an aircraft.
- `Fuselage` is a qualifier term.  In this example, it describes what kind of color is expected.
- A related element in NIEM is `AircraftWingColorCode`.  `Wing` would be the qualifier term in that example.

## Restricted terms

### Type

Avoid use of the term `Type`.  `Type` is reserved as the representation term for NIEM types; it indicates a structure.  Properties should use the term `Category` instead to represent type / category / kind.

NIEM does allow for exceptions when the use of the term `Category` causes confusion over very well-known concepts that use the term `type`.  One such exception is for the element `j:PersonBloodTypeCode`.

### Number

Avoid use of the term `Number` in data names.  Its use is usually too generic to be meaningful or helpful.  A number should usually be an ID (Identifier), Quantity, Numeric (or Value), Amount, Measure, or Duration (of time).

## Other guidance

### No double terms

Do not use double terms (i.e., consecutive identical or similar terms such IDID or NumberNumeric).  Double terms should be replaced with a single instance of the term if it makes sense to do so.

This can sometimes cause different parts of a name, like the property term and the representation term, to be combined into one.

### ID vs Identification

In NIEM, **`ID`** is used as the abbreviation for `Identifier`.  This term is to be used for simple properties - it represents a unique string or number.

NIEM uses **`Identification`** as the representation term for a complex representation of an ID - one that carries not only a unique string or number, but also additional information, like expiration date and the issuer.  This term is typically used by properties with the type `nc:IdentificationType`.
