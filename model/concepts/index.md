[Click here](overview) for a one-page overview of each of the major concepts; otherwise continue on to go through the concepts one-by-one - or jump directly to the one you need more information about.

## The Basics

Fundamentally, a NIEM release consists of a set of namespaces, each of which define properties and types (referred to more generally as components).  An IEPD reuses components from a release that meet its requirements, and creates new properties and types in local namespaces as needed.  These namespaces, properties, and types are basic building blocks of NIEM.

## Advanced

In addition to the basic concepts described above, NIEM defines or uses additional concepts to reflect its conceptual model, improve reusability, and support well-defined information exchanges.
