Augmentation elements are the additional content to be used along with a type from a different namespace.  This is done by making each augmentation element substitutable for the augmentation point element of the original type.

NIEM has two different ways of creating augmentation elements. The most common is by creating a container element and type that bundles related additions together into a single block, and making the container element substitutable for the augmentation point element.  The other method is to make each of the additions individually substitutable for the augmentation point element, without being bundled together.
