Every NIEM release type that contains sub-elements also contains an augmentation point element.  These elements are abstract, have no type, and cannot appear in any instance.  They serve strictly as substitution points, to be replaced by other content - the augmentation elements.

The name of each augmentation point element corresponds to the type in which it appears, with the representation term `"Type"` being replaced by `"AugmentationPoint"`.
