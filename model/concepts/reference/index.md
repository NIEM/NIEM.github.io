## Linked Data

In addition to referencing content defined in the same instance document, it is also possible to reference content defined outside of the instance document.  Resources defined elsewhere may be referenced by a NIEM property via a uniform resource identifier (URI).

This capability was introduced in NIEM 4.0 in support of Linked Data and the semantic web.
