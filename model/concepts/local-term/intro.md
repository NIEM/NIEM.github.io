Local terminology is a word, phrase, acronym, jargon, or other string of characters specially documented in a namespace because it is not defined in a standard dictionary.  Literals or definitions are provided.

Because NIEM is designed to be widely reusable, it is important to make sure semantics are clear, even outside of the given subject matter area.

> For example, Core defines "GSM" as a local term with literal "Global System for Mobile communication".

Once defined at the namespace level, local terminology does not need to be redefined each time it is used.
