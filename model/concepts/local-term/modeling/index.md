## Enhance understanding

Local terminology is provided to improve the understanding of terms by those who do not share the same organization or subject matter background.

## Scope

Local terminology declarations apply to the entire namespace in which they are defined.

This means that:

- A term that is used in multiple properties and/or types in a namespace is only defined once.
- Each namespace must define its own terminology - terminology from Core or other domains cannot be reused.

## Literal or definition

Each local term must have a literal translation or a definition.
