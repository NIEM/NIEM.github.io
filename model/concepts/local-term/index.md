**Local terminology** is {% include_relative def.md %}

To facilitate better understanding across a broad community, NIEM requires that any acronym, abbreviation, jargon, or other word in a component name that is not defined in the Oxford English Dictionary be documented by the namespace that uses it.  For each term, either a literal or a definition must be provided.

Examples from Core:

| Term | Literal | Definition |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| GSM  | Global System for Mobile communication | |
| SSN | Social Security Number | |
| Alpha2 | | Two-letter |
| Alpha3 | | Three-letter |
