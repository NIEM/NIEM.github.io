NIEM differentiates between an object and a role of an object. Roles are used to represent a non-exclusive function or part played by an object.  An object may have one or more roles.  A role may a function of one or more objects.

{:.example}
- Element nc:Weapon is a role of an item
- Element j:Evidence is a role of...
  - an item
  - biometric data
  - a binary file, like an image, video, or audio

Things like cars and chairs are items in NIEM.  In certain situations, however, they may be used as a weapon and/or function as evidence in a trial or hearing.
