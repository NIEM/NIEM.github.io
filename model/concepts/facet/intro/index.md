Facets are additional constraints that may be defined on simple types (like strings or numbers) to limit the allowable values.

They can do such things as limit a string to a pre-defined code list, constrain a number to a given range, or create a pattern that must be followed.

- A telephone number type might define a facet that creates the pattern (ddd) ddd-dddd.
- A week-day type might define facets that constrain a string down to the codes "MON", TUES", "WED", etc.
- A latitude type might define facets that constrain a number to the range -90 and 90.
