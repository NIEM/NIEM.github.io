## Basics

Facets do not exist independently.  They are defined as part of the simple type that they constrain.

- Each facet will have a kind.
- Each facet will have a value.
- Enumeration facets must have a definition.

{: .example}
- A simple type that defines month codes will declare 12 facets:
- The facet kinds will each be "enumeration".
- The facet values will be "JAN", "FEB", "MAR", etc.
- The facet definitions will be "January", "February", "March", etc.

{: .tip}
> Keep in mind that overly-restrictive facets limit reusability, particularly in NIEM release schemas.  For example, facets that restrict a string to the number of characters allowed in a corresponding database field may limit other users with different systems.

## Simple type names

For any simple type that declares a facet...

- If the type contains enumerations, the name of the type must end with `CodeSimpleType`.
- All other simple types must have names that end with with `SimpleType`.
