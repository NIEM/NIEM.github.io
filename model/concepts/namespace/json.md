## Schema example

The example below shows an example JSON schema, based on current guidance.

<!-- 
  Run make in the current directory to update the examples from the json directory.  Jekyll does not include relative files from parent directories.
  -->

```json
{% include_relative samples/schema.jsonld %}
```
