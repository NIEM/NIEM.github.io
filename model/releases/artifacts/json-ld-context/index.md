  title: JSON-LD Context
---

JSON does not support namespace prefixes the same way that XML Schema does.  The JSON-LD context file is a file that associates each NIEM namespace URI with the prefix that is used.

This file is located in the `jsonld-context` folder in the root of the package or repo.
