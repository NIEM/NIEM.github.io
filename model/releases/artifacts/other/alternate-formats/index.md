  title: Alternate Formats
---

- TOC
{:toc}

These are files that contain the model content in formats alternative to the authoritative XML Schemas.  These are provided for developers who  wish to import the model content without having to parse the schemas.

## Formats

- CSVs (text files that represent tablular data)
- Spreadsheet
- Access database

> These materials are different from the spreadsheets in the release package.  The other spreadsheets are formatted to provide user-readable documentation.  These files are formatted to be machine-readable, so that the contents may be **easily imported**.
{:.note}

## Contents

For each format, there is an item (a file, tab, or table) that lists:

- properties
- types
- types with their sub-properties
- type unions
- facets
- namespaces
- local terminology

## Location

On GitHub, the CSV formats are located in the `csv` directory off the root.  The release page on release.niem.gov contains all three formats - CSVs, the spreadsheet, and the Access database.

## Example
