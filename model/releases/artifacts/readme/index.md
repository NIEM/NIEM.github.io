This is a text file that provides a high-level overview of the changes made in the release, and in particular the changes that affect Core.

This file is located in the root of the package or repo.  The file name is `README.md`.  

The format is "Markdown", which provides simple syntax for basic HTML formatting.  Markdown files can be viewed as plain text in any text editor, but the HTML formatting is rendered for a better display on GitHub or a markdown viewer.
