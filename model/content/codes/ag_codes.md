## IrrigationPracticeCodeSimpleType

A data type containing the irrigation practice code used for a unit of land with a crop.
  Irrigated Practice is the method of producing a crop by which water, from an adequate water source, is artificially applied in sufficient amounts by appropriate and adequate irrigation equipment and facilities and at the proper times necessary to produce one of the following:
  1. the yield expected for the area.
  2. the yield used to establish the production guarantee or amount of insurance/coverage on the irrigated acreage planted to the commodity.
  3. the producer established approved yield, as applicable.
  Acreage adjacent to water, such as but not limited to a pond, lake, river, stream, creek or brook, shall not be considered irrigated based solely on the proximity to the water.
