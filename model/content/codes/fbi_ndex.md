## SupervisedReleaseCategoryCodeSimpleType

A data type for a code that identifies a kind of supervised release.

| Code | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| COURTESY SUPERVISION | Courtesy Supervision:  A form of temporary supervision often centered around travel through an otherwise non supervising jurisdiction/district. |
| HOME CONFINEMENT | Released to Home Confinement:  (also called house arrest or home detention) A form of supervision in which a person is confined by order to his or her residence. Travel is usually restricted, if allowed at all.  Home Confinement is a lenient alternative to jail/prison time or juvenile-detention time. |
| MANDATORY RELEASE | Mandatory Release:  (also called mandatory supervision)  Supervision whereby an inmate is released prior to the completion of their sentence due to legal technicalities (often factors "good time") which oblige the criminal justice system to free them.  Where parole is granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board, mandatory release does not involve a decision making process: one either qualifies for it or does not.  Mandatory supervision tends to involve stipulations that are more lenient than those of parole, and in some cases place no obligations at all on the individual being released. |
| MILITARY SUPERVISED RELEASE | Military Supervised Release (MSR):  Through a Memorandum of Understanding between the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and the Department of Defense (DOD), the United States Probation Office provides assistance to military prisoners released from military confinement facilities through parole and supervised release.  The only prisoners eligible fore MSR are those with an approved finding of guilty of an offense that occurred on or after 16 Aug 01, and are eligible for parole, but are not paroled.  All military prisoners prior to being released from confinement on their MRD will be reviewed by the NC and PB for MSR.  All prisoners who fall under the rules of MSR are required to submit an adequate release plan to include employment, residence and aftercare treatment as required. |
| PAROLE | Parole:  A post-prison supervision program where eligible inmates have the terms and conditions of parole set. Parole is a conditional extension of the limits of confinement after an offender has served a minimum part of his sentence. The period of parole cannot exceed the balance of the sentence. Under parole, the offender is to be supervised in the community under specific conditions. |
| PAROLE COMPASSIONATE RELEASE | Parole Compassionate Release:  The release of a subject on medical or humanitarian grounds, such as terminal illness or a child in the community with an urgent need for his or her incarcerated guardian. |
| PAROLE IN STATE | Parole In State (for def. of Parole, see PAROLE) |
| PAROLE OUT OF STATE | Parole Out of State (for def. of Parole, see PAROLE) |
| PAROLE SPECIAL TERM | Special Parole Term:  A term of parole imposed at the expiration of imprisonment or other parole, the offender becomes subject to a Board of Paroles rules and conditions of parole. |
| PRESENTENCE | Presentence:  Bail or Bond Pending Sentence |
| PRETRIAL | Presentence:  Bail or Bond Pretrial |
| PRETRIAL DIVERSION | Pretrial Diversion, includes pretrial intervention, withheld adjudication, good behavior, withdraw and file, deferred prosecution, and withheld sentencing. |
| PROBATION | Probation:  A court-ordered term of community supervision under specified conditions for a specific period of time. The probationer is required to abide by all conditions ordered by the court. Violation of these conditions may result in revocation by the court and imposition of any sentence which it might have imposed before placing the offender on probation. |
| PROBATION IN STATE | Probation In State:  Probation within state of sentencing court, applies to state/local court related probation.  (for def. of Probation, see PROBATION) |
| PROBATION JUVENILE DELINQUENT | Juvenile Delinquent Probation:  Probation resulting from a court finding a person under the age of 21 to be a juvenile delinquent. |
| PROBATION OUT OF STATE | Probation Out of State:  Probation outside state of sentencing court, applies to state/local court related probation.  (for def. of Probation, see PROBATION) |
| UNSPECIFIED | Unspecified Supervised Release:  A high level typing of supervised release used when  a supervising agency cannot provide supervision type.  (Describe Supervised Release) |
| WORK RELEASE | Work Release:  A form of community supervision which allows a prisoner who is sufficiently trusted or can be sufficiently monitored to leave confinement to work at a place of employment or undertake vocational training, returning to facility supervision when his/her work is complete.  Work release is generally designed to facilitate an offenders successful reentry into the community. |

## SupervisedReleaseStatusCodeSimpleType

| Code | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| ABSCONDER | Subject is out of compliance with release conditions, subject is sought, and subjects whereabouts are unknown. |
| ACTIVE | Subject is on supervised release. |

| CANCELED TRANSFERRED | Supervised release was canceled and oversight responsibility for the subject was transferred to another supervising agency. |
| CANCELED UNSUCCESSFUL | Supervised release is unsuccessful and discontinued because the subject was not totally compliant with release conditions and the court, supervising organization, and/or supervising official believed that keeping the subject under supervision was not working and/or there was not a reasonable expectation for improvement in future. |
| COMPLETED | Supervised release is successfully completed. |
| COMPLETED EARLY | Supervised release is successfully completed with early termination afforded the subject as reward for the subjects compliance (paid fines, fulfilled obligations, completed community service, etc.) with release conditions of the court, supervising agency, and/or authorizing organization, or the subject was deemed to have health or life threatening issues at hand that otherwise precluded the subject from otherwise participating in/completing the specified period of supervision. |
