## Overview

NIEM is a large data model, with over 11,000 elements.  Because of the size, it might seem overwhelming to new users, but it isn't necessary to try to review each element.  A basic familiarity with Core and the domains and the ability to search the model is enough to get started.

A good way to begin is to browse through the lists below to get a very high level overview   of the kinds of components that are in Core and the domains.  After that basic overview, follow the links that are most relevant to you to learn more.

## Core

{% include_relative core-summary.md %}

## Domains

{% include_relative domain-summary.md %}

## Code tables
