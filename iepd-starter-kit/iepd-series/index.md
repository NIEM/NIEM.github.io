The material in this area is designed to demonstrate various unique aspects of the NIEM technical framework. It is referred to as the "Superhero" family of IEPDs because they describe comic book characters. This theme was chosen because most people know who Batman and Superman are, and it allowed us to show the NIEM technical framework in a context independent of the existing NIEM domains.

These examples presume a familiarity with the NIEM v3.0 technical specifications (i.e., MPD, NDR, etc.) and common XML principles (i.e., root element, complex type, simple type, etc.). If you are not, the latest NIEM technical specifications are accessible from links at [http://reference.niem.gov](http://reference.niem.gov), and knowledge of XML may be acquired from [http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp) and other online services.

We are open to creating more of these worked examples from community generated ideas. If you have ideas on how to improve or extend the concepts provided here please [contact us](https://www.niem.gov/contact-us)!
