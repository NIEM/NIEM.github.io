title: Conformance Validation
---
Conformance Validation for IEPDs will be tested using the updated NIEM 3.0 ConTesA that is currently under development.

The [Model Package Description 3.0](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0/model-package-description-3.0.html) specification defines the contents and structure of IEPDs including metadata, XML Schema documents, and documentation.

the [Naming and Design Rules 3.0](http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/3.0/NIEM-NDR-3.0-2014-07-31.html) specification defines the XML Schema documents for use with NIEM.
