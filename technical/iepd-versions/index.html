<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This FAQ relates best practices for NIEM IEPD change control and versioning.
Before discussing these concepts as they relate specifically to an IEPD,
we begin with an overview of the NIEM architecture, and follow that 
with several applicable FAQs about NIEM change control in general. 
</p>

<p>Please help improve this content by <a href="{{ site.submit_feedback_link }}">sending your feedback and additional questions</a>!</p>

<p>The audience is intended to be NIEM IEPD developers and implementers 
who transmit or share NIEM IEPs based on one or more IEPDs. 
The scope covers all aspects of IEPD change control and versioning 
based on NIEM releases, including how NIEM releases relate to IEPDs and their 
implementations, compatibility, and what users and implementers should expect. 
The intent is to help the NIEM community understand how to implement NIEM effectively 
in the context of annual releases, and know the limitations and trade-offs.</p>

<h3>High-Level Overview of the NIEM Architecture</h3>

<p>As a point of reference, below is a very simple introduction to the NIEM architecture.
The NIEM reference model (top layer) is a collection of XML Schema data components 
organized into NIEM Core and more specialized Domains. These components provide 
the NIEM common vocabulary, structures, and semantics.

<p>(Skip the EIEM layer 2 for the moment.)</p>

<p>An IEPD (layer 3) defines a given recurring information exchange by reusing 
data components in a release of the NIEM reference model.</p>

<p>A NIEM implementation (layer 4) is the hardware/software/system infrastructure 
needed to send and receive NIEM IEPs (layer 5). 
These are XML instance documents that carry data and are defined by one or more IEPDs. 
To design/build an IEPD from a reference model, a developer assembles the required 
XML Schema data components into a subset of the reference model 
(reusing only the components needed). 
For requirements that NIEM cannot satisfy, the developer 
either extends existing components or creates new components (per the 
<a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/3.0/"
>NIEM Naming and Design Rules</a> (NDR)).</p>

<p>If a developer must design/build a set of IEPDs, it is sometimes more efficient 
to employ the EIEM architectural layer (layer 2). In this approach the developer 
builds a subset of all the data components needed for the set of IEPDs. 
The developer extends or creates as needed to satisfy missing requirements. 
Then the developer designs/builds a family of IEPDs reusing the master subset, 
associated extensions, and possibly external standards. 
(Note that the concept of the EIEM layer is still fairly 
immature and not yet normatively specified in NIEM.

<h2>IEPD Change Control and Version Management - Guidance and Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


    <h3>NIEM change control and versioning</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>What release versions of NIEM are available?</b>
        <p>NIEM release versions currently available are: 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, and
          3.0.  These are all available for download
          at <a href="http://release.niem.gov/">http://release.niem.gov/</a>.
          There are also a few domain updates and core supplements that can be
          used in IEPDs available in the NIEM Publication Area at
          <a href="http://publication.niem.gov/niem/">http://publication.niem.gov/niem/</a>.
	  Original Domain updates and Core supplements are always available in the 
          Publication Area to use with the existing releases to which they apply. 
          However, Domain updates and Core supplements are also harmonized with 
          and integrated into the next major or minor release.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>How are NIEM schema documents versioned?</b>
        <p>A NIEM schema document identifies its version within
          the <code>targetNamespace</code> attribute owned by
          the <code>xs:schema</code>.
          The <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/3.0/">NIEM
          NDR</a> requires that every NIEM conformant schema document have a
          unique <code>targetNamespace</code>.  This includes all schema
          documents in releases and domain updates, and that are IEPD
          extensions.  For example, within NIEM 3.0,
          the <code>targetNamespace</code> for the Biometrics Domain schema
          document (<code>biom.xsd</code>)
          is <a href="http://release.niem.gov/niem/domains/biometrics/3.0/"><code>http://release.niem.gov/niem/domains/biometrics/3.0/</code></a>;
          and the <code>targetNamespace</code> for the Justice Domain schema
          document (<code>jxdm.xsd</code>)
          is <a href="http://release.niem.gov/niem/domains/jxdm/5.0/"
          ><code >http://release.niem.gov/niem/domains/jxdm/5.0/</code></a>.
          (NOTE: The only exception to this rule is a NIEM subset schema.  See
          the next FAQ about subsets.)  If no changes to a schema document are
          required, then its <code>targetNamespace</code> will not change, and
          the schema document will go forward into future releases as-is.  Only
          when the content of a schema document changes must
          its <code >targetNamespace</code > change.  When changed, generally
          only the version identifier (<code >3.0</code>, <code>5.0</code>,
          etc.) portion of the <code >targetNamespace</code > URI will be
          modified.  However, this is only a convention, not a normative rule,
          so in reality the entire <code >targetNamespace</code> string
          determines the version of a NIEM schema document.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>How are NIEM subset schema documents versioned?</b>
        <p>In NIEM, the <code>targetNamespace</code> of a subset schema 
	  document based on a reference schema document (within a release) 
          is never unique.  A subset schema document always takes the 
          <code>targetNamespace</code> of the reference schema document 
          from which it was built. 
          (See <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1rc1/model-package-description-3.0.1rc1.html#section_4.2.2"
          >Model Package Description 3.0.1</a> for subsetting operations.)  
          This is because a subset schema is essentially a reduced copy (i.e., 
          a subset) of that reference schema document.  So, an XML document
          instance defined by a subset schema document is also defined by its
          associated reference schema document.  And in fact, a conformant
          subset schema document must be replaceable by the full reference
          schema.  This also explains why the <code >targetNamespace</code> for
          a subset schema document does not change; each is based on a published
          reference schema document.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>When, if ever, can a NIEM <code>targetNamespace</code> or schema
          document be changed?</b>
        <p>An important practice is that after a NIEM XML schema document has
          been officially released and published, neither its content nor
          its <code>targetNamespace</code> can be changed.  We say that
          published NIEM reference schemas (releases) live forever.  This policy
          ensures that the official NIEM releases (i.e., reference models) are
          always available to support information exchanges until an author or
          sponsor is ready to change them.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Are NIEM versioning policies in standard practice by all
          organizations?</b>
        <p>No.  Some standards development organizations (SDO) do not follow the
          NIEM versioning policies.  Some change content directly within a
          published <code>targetNamespace</code>.  Others use a similar
          technique, but add a version identifier that is not a part of the
          namespace.  In such cases, it can be difficult to know if the content
          of a namespace has changed (and which version you have).  The NIEM
          namespace policy ensures absolute transparency of change.  If two NIEM
          schema documents bear different target namespaces, then their content
          is different.  Furthermore, within NIEM artifacts that use them (such
          as IEPDs), subset schema documents must be explicitly identified.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>I've heard that "a NIEM minor release is backward compatible."  Is
          this true?</b>
        <p>There is a bit of truth to this statement.  A NIEM major series of
          releases is numbered as follows: 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, etc.  One and only one
          NIEM Core schema document (version 3.0)
          and <code >targetNamespace</code > is common to all of these releases.
          The next NIEM major release (version 4.0) will change the NIEM Core
          schema document.  So, release 4.0 will not use the 3.0 Core schema
          document.  Thus, one might say that the NIEM 3.0 series (i.e.,
          versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, etc.)  is compatible in terms of Core because
          all versions in the series use the same NIEM Core schema document.
          However, domain schema documents may change in ways that prevent
          backward compatibility between minor releases within a major
          series.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>What is <i>XML schema validation</i>, and what does it mean to
          be <i>schema-valid</i>?</b>
        <p><i>XML schema validation</i> is the process of checking an XML
          document to determine if it conforms to (or is defined by) an XML
          schema with which it has been associated.  Although not considered
          part of validation, all valid XML documents must also be syntactically
          well-formed.  Essentially, this means its XML open/close tags are
          complete and balanced.  A <i>schema-valid</i> XML document has passed
          a validation check against an associated schema.  In NIEM, these terms
          refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema#dev">W3C XML Schema</a>
          validity.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>IEPD change control and versioning</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>How are IEPDs versioned?</b>
        <p>The method and scheme for versioning IEPDs is very similar to that
          used for NIEM releases.  An IEPD is assigned a unique URI that is
          under the control of the IEPD author or sponsor.  If significant
          changes are made to an IEPD then authors are expected to change the
          URI for that IEPD.  This is a MUST if changes will impact XML instance
          document validation with the IEPD schema.  Insignificant changes may
          not require a change in URI.  For example, text corrections or minor
          clarifications to IEPD documentation (where it does not impact schema
          validation) might not require a URI change.  This decision is left to
          the judgement of IEPD authors, sponsors, or certification authorities.
          (See
          the <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#section_5.2.4.1"
          >NIEM Model Package Description 3.0.1 - Section 5.2.4.1</a > for IEPD
          URI syntax details and rationales.)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Who is responsible for managing versions of a NIEM IEPD?</b>
        <p>While related to NIEM by reusing data components in published
          representations of the reference model (releases), an IEPD is authored
          independently of NIEM.  The IEPD author, developer, or sponsor is
          responsible for managing IEPD versions.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>How can I determine the version of a NIEM release (releases) used in
          an IEPD?</b>
        <p>There are at least two ways to determine the NIEM release used by an
          IEPD.  First, an IEPD author should identify the NIEM release
          version(s) in use within the documentation.  A second method is to
          inspect <code>targetNamespace</code> attributes within the IEPD's
          schema documents and compare them to their respective reference schema
          documents (within the releases).  Core related schemas documents such
          as <code>niem-core.xsd</code> and <code>structures.xsd</code> can only
          identify the major series (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.).  This is because Core
          does not change from one minor release to the next within a major
          series.  For example, NIEM 2.0 and 2.1 both contain the same 2.0 Core
          schema document with same <code>targetNamespace</code>.  Domain and
          code list schema documents can help to identify the minor release
          series (second integer).  But be sure to compare to the release schema
          documents, because some domains (such as Justice) and some code lists
          have legacy versioning schemes that do not correspond directly to the
          release version.  For example, the current version number in the
          Justice <code>targetNamespace</code> URI is 5.0, not 3.0.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Can an IEPD employ data components from more than one NIEM release
          version?</b>
        <p>The
          NIEM <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/"
          >Model Package Description Specification 3.0.1</a> allows an IEPD to
          employ XML data components from multiple NIEM releases.  This means
          that schema subsets from multiple releases can be used together in a
          single IEPD.  That said, mixing releases in an IEPD can introduce
          multiple versions of the same XML elements and types (sometimes with
          slightly different structures) resulting in semantic duplication,
          overlap, and potential ambiguity.  On the other hand, each NIEM
          release has been harmonized to remove as much duplication as possible.
          Therefore, we strongly recommend that an IEPD be designed to use a
          single NIEM release version.  This practice is easier to control, less
          complex, and less error-prone.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Can I use NIEM domain updates (DU) and/or core supplements (CS) in my
          IEPD?</b>
        <p>A NIEM domain update (DU) is a
          <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0.1/model-package-description-3.0.1.html#definition_model_package_description"
          >model package description (MPD)</a> that contains one or more schema
          documents representing changes to one or more domains.  A NIEM core
          supplement (CS) is a special release MPD that contains one or more
          schema documents representing additive-only changes to a published
          NIEM Core.  An IEPD may incorporate DUs and CSs.  That said, semantic
          overlap and duplication that can occur by mixing multiple NIEM
          releases within an IEPD (See FAQ above), may also happen when using a
          DU (or CS).  This is because a DU changes a given domain's
          published <code>targetNamespace</code> by creating a
          new <code>targetNamespace</code> and applying the changes there.  In
          doing so, it may replicate data components defined by
          the <code>targetNamespace</code> it changes.
          (See <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/high-level-version-architecture/3.0/"
          >NIEM High Level Version Architecture 3.0</a>.)  Furthermore, the
          trade-off for allowing NIEM domains to reuse (and reference) each
          others' data components while also independently publish changes
          outside the regular release cycle, is that over time the level of
          semantic overlap can increase across a given release and its
          associated DUs and CSs.  To the extent possible, within an IEPD avoid
          mixing duplicate versions of the same data component.  Use the subset
          technique where possible to reduce duplication; but realize that some
          level of semantic duplication and overlap may be unavoidable.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <b>"An IEPD is the point of NIEM interoperability." ... What does this
          mean?</b>
        <p>Once published, a NIEM release is always available as-is under a
          unique <code>targetNamespace</code>.  So, once designed and built from
          an existing NIEM release (and optionally any existing domain updates
          (DU) or core supplements (CS), an IEPD implementation establishes
          interoperability among senders/receivers of XML instance documents
          (IEPs) that validate to the IEPD's schema document set.  This means that
          a NIEM implementation is immune to NIEM changes (new releases, DUs, and
          CSs), and will continue to work as long as IEPs (XML instance documents)
          are schema-valid to the original IEPD schema document set.  Furthermore,
          if the IEPD schemas change and the implementation changes accordingly,
          and the changes are such that the schema document set is backward
          compatible (see <i>backward compatibility above</i>) with the previous
          set before the changes, then the implementation will continue to work
          with the old and new XML instance documents.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Must an IEPD be updated (changed) when a new NIEM release is published?</b>
        <p>No, an IEPD is not required to change as a result of NIEM evolution.
          If the data exchange requirements for which the IEPD was developed are
          still valid, then there is no reason to update the IEPD (even if new
          content in a recent NIEM release or domain update is available).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>When must an IEPD be updated to a new NIEM release version?</b>
        <p>All previously published NIEM releases are always available at the
          <a href="http://release.niem.gov/">NIEM release</a> Web site.
          Therefore, if an IEPD continues to satisfy its information sharing
          requirements as designed or implemented, then it is not necessary to
          update it because there is a newer NIEM release.  When an IEPD author,
          sponsor, implementer, or the exchanging parties determine that: (1)
          data exchange requirements have evolved significantly enough; or (2)
          newer NIEM content is available and the need to use it within data
          exchanges exists; then, it may also be necessary to consider an IEPD
          update and likely an update to all corresponding IEPD
          implementations.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>What does IEPD versioning look like for producer and consumer
          implementations?</b>
        <p>Information producers and consumers must synchronize any IEP (XML
          instance document) exchanged through the XML schema definitions in the
          IEPD that define the IEP.  This means that (1) the IEPD implementation
          must understand the IEPD schema assembled from the IEPD schema
          document set; so that (2) the implementation must recognize and
          correctly process all elements of an incoming IEP (XML instance
          document) defined by the IEPD; and (3) the IEP must be schema-valid to
          the IEPD schema document set.  Therefore, producer and consumer
          implementations of an IEPD must be aware of the IEPD versions their
          software implementations are based on.</p>
      </li>  
    </ol>

    <h3>Backward compatibility</h3>
    <ol>

      <li>
        <b>What is <i>backward compatibility</i> in XML Schema?</b>
        <p>Consider a single XML schema document that defines a set of XML
          instance documents.  This means that each XML instance document in the
          set is schema valid to the schema document.  If the schema document is
          changed, then the nature of the changes will determine how different
          the set of valid XML instance documents is now as a result of changes.
          Schema document changes might be such that the original set of valid
          XML instance documents are still valid for the new (modified) schema,
          and other new XML instance documents are also valid.  This can happen
          if, for example, one or more additional XML elements are added to an
          XML type definition with cardinality (<code>minOccurs</code>) set to
          zero (i.e., use of these elements is optional).  This is essentially
          backward compatibility, i.e., the new changed XML schema is backward
          compatible with the previous XML schema, because the original set of
          valid XML instance documents are still valid to the new schema
          document.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Does NIEM support backward compatibility?</b>
        <p>No, NIEM does not support backward compatibility out-of-the-box.
          NIEM does not and cannot guarantee that an IEPD built from any given
          major or minor release version will be backward compatible with an
          IEPD built from an earlier release.  However, under certain conditions
          it may be possible to design, build, and change an IEPD such that it
          is backward compatible for the same set of schema-valid IEPs it
          defined before it was changed.  See the next question below.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>How can I build an IEPD that supports/maintains backward
          compatibility with older IEPs?</b>
        <p>To design and build such an IEPD requires some degree of
          pre-planning.  The author must be prepared to limit the kinds of
          changes he can apply to later versions of the IEPD.  Subsequent
          changes to the IEPD schema documents must preserve the original set of
          valid IEPs, while allowing for new valid members of that set.  Such
          changes are generally additive-only and may include (but are not
          limited to): add elements with <code>minOccurs="0"</code> to types;
          add elements to existing substitution groups; relax (not restrict)
          cardinality constraints; and employ wildcards (as appropriate).  As
          long as changes to the IEPD schema documents do not render previously
          schema-valid IEPs invalid, then backward compatibility is
          preserved.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>How can two different versions of an IEPD be processed by one
          implementation?</b>
        <p>A software implementation can process one or more versions of an
          IEPD.  The software should have a set of data structures for the data
          set defined by each IEPD (for example, a set of Java objects for each
          IEPD).  The software will associate an incoming IEP (XML instance)
          with one of two namespaces to determine which set of data structures
          to use for the incoming IEP.  To do this, it parses the IEP document
          element to identify the unique namespace of the schema that defines
          that element.  This namespace identifies which set of data structures
          to load with the incoming IEP data and subsequently process.</p>
