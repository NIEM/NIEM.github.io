## Meetings, communications, accounts for participation


### Regular meetings (who, what, when, where, why)

- __NIEM Business Architecture Committee (NBAC)__ &mdash; [NBAC](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/nbac/Pages/default.aspx) meets (by teleconference) on the last Thursday of every month from 2:00-3:00pm.  Its primary missions are to identify the data requirements for NIEM, govern NIEM [Core], and assist the domains with the management of their models.  NBAC coordinates with NTAC, the PMO, and the domains.
- __NBAC Content Subcommittee__ &mdash; This group is a standing subcommittee under [NBAC][NBAC] that meets (by teleconference) as often as necessary to resolve issues, refactor (remodel) NIEM content, and harmonize. During a NIEM release cycle this subcommittee meets fairly regularly to prepare for the initial alpha release. Meeting times and dates are subject to change and are established by the lead developer in coordination with subcommittee members. 
- __NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC)__ &mdash; [NTAC](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/ntac/Pages/default.aspx) meets (by teleconference) every other week on Wednesday from 1:30-3:00pm.  Its primary missions are to identify new NIEM technical requirements, govern the NIEM architecture (the structure of the model), oversee the NIEM technical specifications and the tool strategy. NTAC coordinates with NBAC, the PMO, and the domains. 
- __Program Management Office (PMO)__ &mdash; [PMO](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/Pages/pmo.aspx) holds a regular coordination meeting (via teleconference) every other Monday from 1:00-2:00pm. This meeting is generally for the PMO staff, goverance committee co-chairs, lead developer, and key representatives of the largest domains. 
- A __Joint NTAC/NBAC Face-to-Face meeting__ is generally hosted twice a year by the PMO in the Washington DC area. Exact dates vary, but meetings are generally 2-3 days in Apr/May and Oct/Nov timeframes. Dates are usually timed to coincide with key milestones in a release cycle.  These meetings are generally for all NBAC and NTAC members, all domain stewards or representatives, the lead developer, and the PMO staff. These meetings have multiple purposes, including reviewing material for a developing release, technical updates, reviewing the previous year, planning the next year, coordination between NBAC and NTAC, etc.

### Questions, comments, recommendations regarding NIEM

If you are a domain representative developing NIEM content or maintaining your domain namespace, or if you are an NBAC or NTAC member, then please talk directly to the lead developer for technical assistance. This is your privilege as a member of NIEM governance. The lead developer (GTRI) participates in all NIEM governance meetings, so please don't hesitate to ask the lead developer for technical help. They will be happy to schedule a telephone appointment to talk with you. Asking questions, making suggestions or recommendations through these resources are more for your constituents. You can use these resources too, but for technical assistance it is usually faster to contact the lead developer directly.
