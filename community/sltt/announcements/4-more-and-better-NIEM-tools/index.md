### More and better NIEM Tools

*Wednesday, January 19, 2022*

- Release 5.2 of NIEM is in final release stages, with new data components in many domains and improvements in the way NIEM can use JSON instead of XML for the specification of exchange content.  
- The new metamodel of NIEM that allows the creation of an ontology using OWL and RDF, making NIEM more useful in the application of knowledge graph technology and other forms of exchange, is nearing completion and will offer new modes of interoperability across many use cases.
- A new on-line, interactive training program will be rolled out in 2022 to support technology training associated with the new 5th generation of NIEM and its attributes.
