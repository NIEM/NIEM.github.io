Genericode is a XML representation for code lists defined by OASIS in 2007. The
[NIEM Code Lists Specification](../niem-code-lists-specification) leverages
Genericode as a method of representing code lists in NIEM information exchange
specifications.

The [OASIS Genericode
specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/cs-genericode-1.0/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html)
defines the Genericode XML format.

## Tools

Since Genericode is an XML syntax, a person may use any standard XML tools to work
with Genericode. In addition, some tools provide specific support for Genericode
code lists.

### Crane Softwrights Code List Resources

[Crane Softwrights' page on OASIS UBL and Code List
Resources](http://www.cranesoftwrights.com/resources/ubl/index.htm#codelist)
features a package containing XSLT files that can convert a specially-structured
CSV file to Genericode.

### Webb Roberts's Code List Tools

[Webb Roberts provides a set of code list tools on
Github](https://github.com/webb/code-list-tools) that include
Unix/Linux/Mac command-line tools that:

  1. Convert Excel/spreadsheet CSV files to Genericode files.
  2. Validate Genericode files against the Genericode schema and additional rules.

You can download a [complete release of Webb's code list
tools](https://github.com/webb/code-list-tools/releases).
