## Welcome to the future home of NIEM training

We are currently working to modernize our training material which includes moving away from the [current online material](https://niem.gov/training) and into user-driven tutorials and reference content on GitHub. Itâ€™s an evolution based on how people learn these days.

The content in development will address the two types of training audiences we historically see:
1.	Someone who is already familiar with NIEM and is looking for quick reference material to determine or verify how to do something.
2.	Someone who is a newcomer to NIEM and needs to get up to speed on how to do things. This could include managing domain model content, developing an exchange, implementing an exchange, publishing a data set, or reusing the vocabulary.

This section represents our *in progress* work. As we knock out content, we push it out to the user community for feedback and use.
