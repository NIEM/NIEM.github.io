## IEPD Implementer Tools and Specifications

The goal of NIEM is to provide a common data model, architecture, and framework to support more consistent, reusable, and scalable information exchanges.  By the time a conformant IEPD is published, it should already:

1. Have all of the NIEM-specific rules and guidances about developing the data model and IEPDs built in, and
2. Capture and fully represent all of the local exchange requirements.

The IEPD should include such things as schemas to enable message validation, well-named and well-defined components, and sample instances and other documentation that demonstrate and describe the format and requirements of the exchange.  This bundle of artifacts does not require any NIEM-specific tools or specifications to implement - NIEM is independent of any particular software or environment.

See the [NIEM Tools Catalog](https://www.niem.gov/tools-catalog) for information about community and commercially-available tools.
