The **[NIEM High-Level Version Architecture (HLVA) Specification]({{ site.data.links.hlva }})** identifies the processes, artifacts, and responsibilities required to produce new releases of the NIEM model.  It also establishes a regular release cycle for predictable and manageable NIEM updates.

## Objectives

The HLVA was designed to meet the following objectives:

- A domain may issue a [domain update](../../release/domain-update) as needed to publish content changes outside of the regular release cycle.
- IEPDs may reuse content from NIEM releases and domain updates.
- Domain updates are incorporated into the next NIEM release.
- A clear process is available for domains to participate in Core-related harmonization and issue resolution.
- A reliable schedule exists for releases and release activities.
- All NIEM content changes are visible, via uniquely identified schemas and from change logs.

## Status

This specification is being stood down by the NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC).  The content in the specification is being migrated directly into this site, primarily in the [Reference / Release]({{ "/reference/release/" | relative_url }}) section.
