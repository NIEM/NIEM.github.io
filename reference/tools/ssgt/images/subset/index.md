Properties and types may be removed from a subset.

## Delete Individual Component

- Mark the checkbox next to the appropriate property, type, or sub-property in the subset list on the left.
- Click the **`Delete Checked`** button to remove all of the selections and dependencies from the subset.

> If no checkbox is available next to the component, that is because it is a dependency and cannot be removed manually as long as other components that require it are still in the subset.

## Delete All

An entire subset may be removed.

- Click the **`Clear Subset`** button.
