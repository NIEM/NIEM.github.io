In addition to objects and properties, NIEM provides a few other ways to define the contents of a data exchange including:
* [Associations](associations) - relationships between objects
* [Augmentations](augmentations) - extensions (additional properties) added to an object
* [Metadata](metadata) - information about objects or properties (e.g. the source or security level of the information).
* [Roles](roles) - Temporary functions played by objects (e.g. the person that is the subject of a case).
