title: Example JSON Schema
---
The OASIS LegalXML Electronic Court Filing (ECF) 5.0 specification defines a number of NIEM 4.0 information
exchanges with courts.

Here is the ECF 5.0 GetCourtSchedulingRequestMessage to request a court hearing implemented in JSON schema:

```json
{%include_relative schema.json %}
```

An example of a JSON request based on the JSON schema is:

```json
{%include_relative instance.json %}
```
