## Highlights

The success of the [Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM)](https://it.ojp.gov/initiatives/gjxdm) for the justice community led to the creation of NIEM with a multi-domain model.  GJXDM content was refactored into two core namespaces and a new Justice domain; other new domains were added.
