## Highlights

NIEM changed its philosophy from 1.0 on NIEM Core and moved away from the idea that it could reflect what the community most often used in practice or could easily support.  NIEM Core (nc) was consolidated from the Universal Core (U) and Common Core (c) namespaces in NIEM 1.0.  It became the designated place for content that did not belong to a single authoritative source and should thus be managed collaboratively by the NIEM Business Architecture Committee, which includes representatives from all NIEM domains.

- Merged Universal Core (u) and Common Core (c) into a single **NIEM Core** (nc) namespace
- Included an ANSI NIST namespace to represent Biometrics data
- Reviewed Core and moved a number of justice-specific components into the Justice domain
- Performed additional harmonization work across the domains
