## Highlights

{:.box}
- **NIEM adopted a new annual release strategy** with a 3-year cycle: a major release one year would be followed by minor releases the next two years.

- Added the **Biometrics** (biom) domain - *replaced the ANSI NIST namespace from NIEM 2.0*

- The **Family Services** (fs) domain was renamed as **Children, Youth, and Family Services** (cyfs)

- **Military Operations** (mo) debuted as a domain update after the NIEM 3.0 release

- **[Augmentations]({{ "/reference/concepts/augmentation/element/" | relative_url }})** were revised to use element substitution instead of type extension.
  - This addressed challenges users had faced with the limits of type extension, which only allowed for the use of an augmentation for a type from a single domain.
  - Element substitution allows for IEPD developers to use multiple domain augmentations to be used in combination together.

- Extensive review and harmonization of Core components

- Simplified XML schema syntax of elements and types

- Added the `conformanceTargets` attribute to NIEM schemas to allow users to explicitly designate which NIEM specifications and rule sets are applicable

- Added support for local terminology, allowing namespaces to define subject area-specific terms that do not appear in standard dictionaries
